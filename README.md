This is a repo of a AchtungDieKurve (Netacka) program written in C with a possibility to play online.
An offline version also exists.
For building both versions the SDL library, fonts and headers are needed.
On ubuntu the following installs all requirements for building:

`sudo apt-get install SDL libsdl2-2.0-0 libsdl-ttf2.0-0 libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev`


So far the testing environment is not working and the windows version is shaky but on linux (Ubuntu 14) it works!

Enjoy!!

PS: Plans on adding bots are on route!
